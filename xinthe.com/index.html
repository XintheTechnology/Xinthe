              <p>For decades, organizations of all sizes have harnessed the power of software to streamline operations, enhance efficiency, and reduce expenses. In the early days, custom development reigned supreme, before the pendulum swung towards off-the-shelf (OTS) solutions. However, businesses often grappled with intricate requirements ill-suited to generic OTS offerings. As a result, hybrid solutions - masterful blends of OTS and bespoke software - emerged, capturing an ever-expanding market share.</p>
              <p><strong>Xinthe</strong> has been an integral part of this metamorphosis, primarily excelling in custom development by addressing process and reporting gaps, assimilating external systems, and orchestrating ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) operations from OTS systems to reporting platforms.</p>
              <h4> Bridge The Technological Divide With Xinthe</h4>
              <p>At <strong>Xinthe</strong>, we specialize in crafting end-to-end solutions, seamlessly integrating diverse systems and filling the voids to forge a comprehensive, unified solution. With an unwavering commitment to achieving 'Absolute Customer Satisfaction,' we astutely comprehend the distinctiveness of each client, honing in on project challenges and pivotal necessities.

              <p>Imbued with product engineering prowess, <strong>Xinthe</strong>'s DNA comprises proven multi-sector development methodologies and the cumulative expertise of our innovative software developers. This engineering acumen empowers clients to optimize costs, expedite time-to-market, and ensure progressive quality and advanced features in every release.</p>
              <p>Our holistic approach melds agile practices to construct custom solutions, regardless of complexity, within an accelerated development timeline. Agile thinking affords heightened control over the development process, guaranteeing quality and stakeholder visibility. Moreover, it provides flexibility to accommodate eleventh-hour modifications, risk mitigation, and ultimately, a superior ROI.</p>
              <p>Quality remains our paramount priority. <strong>Xinthe</strong> boasts a cadre of quality assurance specialists proficient in manual and automation testing. Employing functional, system, stress, performance, usability, and acceptance testing techniques, we ensure your product emerges pristine and bug-free upon release.</p>

              <p>In the realm of IT, deployment is merely the first milestone in a journey that unfolds over an application's entire lifecycle. Continuous maintenance necessitates regular monitoring, routine upkeep, and peak performance optimization. Proactive error resolution and heeding warnings are crucial to prevent any potential disruption to your business. </p>
              <p>Despite having state-of-the-art monitoring tools at their disposal, many businesses find themselves in a bind owing to the lack of resources required to manage these tools and interpret the data they produce. Debugging errors, enhancing performance, and rooting out the underlying issues can prove to be complex tasks. These challenges often necessitate software modifications and comprehensive regression testing before the resulting changes can be safely implemented and propagated across the system.</p>
              <p>Xinthe steps up to the plate here, assuming these responsibilities and going the extra mile to ensure your applications maintain consistent top-tier performance and reliability.</p>
              <p><strong>Xinthe</strong> can take this on and more, so your applications deliver sustained performance and reliability.</p>
              <h4>Xinthe - Your Partner in Business Continuity</h4>
              <p>With our detail-oriented teams backed by extensive industry experience and best-practice protocols, <strong>Xinthe</strong> ensures your critical applications are always online and performing optimally. We can handle a spectrum of tasks, from minor enhancements and bug fixes to large-scale enterprise software implementations.</p>
              <p>We employ automation in our monitoring processes wherever feasible, using off-the-shelf alerting tools or our in-house MyAlertX - a powerful alerting engine designed to dispatch automated notifications to the designated engineers, bolstered by a structured escalation matrix. Our monitoring strategy is further reinforced with tools for version control, branching workflows, security updates, and automated software deployment, ensuring your applications' long-term performance, stability, and scalability.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, our production support factors in the need for ongoing enhancements to existing systems. Our model incorporates software development services to swiftly implement these enhancements, thereby minimizing system downtime, curbing performance degradation, and reducing security risks.</p>

              <p>Venture into the future with the cloud, a high-powered ally enabling businesses to zero-in on their strategic endeavors. The cloud is not merely a cost-cutting or opportunity-unleashing tool - it's an innovation-driving, delivery-enhancing, and legacy-issue-resolving powerhouse. As internet-centric data increasingly overshadows datacenter traffic, a paradigm-shift is not just visible, but inevitable. A whopping 70% of network traffic has already taken the off-premise route, compelling an organization-wide shift towards cloud-centric IT strategies.</p>
              <p>The journey to off-premise excellence, however, is not a trouble-free cruise. Cloud migration is a comprehensive affair that extends beyond merely deploying cloud-based applications - it calls for well-orchestrated planning. An underprepared approach risks schedule-slippages, budget-blowouts, exposed security loopholes, discontented customers, and a dip in productivity. This is where Xinthe enters the picture.</p>

        <img src="images/alertx.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="AlertX" /><br />
       
       MyAlertX is designed particularly for the IT operations management sector, a domain characterized by complex task coordination, incident management, and real-time user collaboration. It addresses the key challenges of efficient incident escalation, user rotation, and effective project management, especially in high-pressure, deadline-driven environments.
<br />
       <br />
The MyAlertX application focuses on streamlining the incident management workflow. It assigns incidents based on predefined user levels, automatically escalating matters to higher levels when required. This tiered approach reduces bottlenecks and ensures a smooth, uninterrupted flow of tasks. MyAlertX's alert system informs users about new incidents, status changes, and switch requests, maintaining transparency and facilitating quicker decision-making.
<br />
       <br />
On the project management front, MyAlertX enables an efficient rotation system based on daily, weekly, or monthly schedules. It includes a "switch user request" feature, giving users the flexibility to delegate tasks while maintaining accountability. Projects are neatly categorized with clear indicators for duty status and snooze durations, allowing for easy tracking and management.
<br />
       <br />
One of MyAlertX's standout features is the comprehensive logging system, accessible exclusively by level 4 users (Observers). This feature provides an overview of all incidents, their statuses, and detailed user response records, offering valuable insights for performance evaluation and process improvement.
<br />
       <br />
The application also ensures seamless interaction with popular external services via Rest APIs like Cherwell, JIRA, SolarWinds, etc., providing the ability to pull in data and functionality from these platforms.
<br />
       <br />
With a user-friendly mobile interface and a robust cloud-based server architecture, MyAlertX aims to transform the way IT operations management teams coordinate, communicate, and control their work environment, providing a seamless, efficient, and effective solution for incident and project management.

               A quintessential part of daily life since the 1930s, convenience stores serve as scaled-down versions of full-fledged grocery stores, deftly combining the essentials of retail with the practicality of attached fuel stations. This symbiotic relationship between a convenience store (or C-store) and its corresponding gas station is a strategically sound business model, capitalizing on the relatively higher margins from C-store items versus fuel sales to drive foot traffic and amplify profitability. As a result, the convenience store sector has emerged as a formidable and steady growth engine in the retail landscape.
 				<br /><br />
Much like their larger counterparts in the retail industry, C-stores grapple with the intricate challenges of escalating customer-centricity and advancing digitization. However, owing to their curated product assortment and compact retail space, the primary task for C-stores remains the optimization of inventory management. This calls for profound consumer insights to fine-tune inventory, spur category innovation, and reimagine services - like click & collect or home delivery. Beyond the customer-facing storefront, there is an implicit need for C-stores to evolve from a linear supply chain model to a complex, interconnected supply chain network.
 				<br /><br />
Furthermore, as the sector continues to expand, it encounters additional complexity due to mergers and acquisitions. These often result in the integration of disparate systems, consolidation of purchase agreements, and alignment of profits and losses.
 				<br /><br />
Here at Xinthe, we leverage our specialized know-how across diverse domains, devising solutions tailored to equip convenience stores with the digital infrastructure they require. Our aim is to empower these stores to not only compete but thrive amidst the fluctuating dynamics of a consumer-driven market. This strategic amalgamation of our competencies and insights, combined with our innovative digital solutions, serves to enhance operational efficiency, customer experience, and ultimately, drive growth for convenience stores in this dynamic landscape.

                <h4>Vendors and C-Stores integration</h4>
                Xinthe introduced an innovative solution towards the integration of existing Vendors to C-Store chain. 
                <br /><br />
This enhanced vendor portal provides brand representatives with an efficient, user-friendly platform to manage their brand relted products, prices and promotions where there is a contract with the client. All different types of promotions like bulk sales, promotional pricing are accommodated as per the customer needs. A key feature of this solution is its robust security and review process. Once an item is created by a brand representative, it undergoes thorough scrutiny by the Category Manager and Pricebook Manager, who are vested with the final authority to either accept or reject the item(s) and pricing. The approved products are available in the store through seamless integration of the portal and ERP system. This meticulous approval process ensures the quality and suitability of each item before it is enlisted in the store. The Vendor Portal exhibits Xinthe's prowess at crafting industry-specific solutions that facilitate operational efficiency, improve security measures, and augment user experience.

                    Usually Retail  / Convenience stores has different channels where upstream and downstream of data passes among different systems supportng the operations of the organization. A transformative strategy and implementation to streamline and centralize the process is considerable effort.
                    <br /><br />
Replacing legacy methods like DoS Scripts, interdependent processes without proper failure tracking mechanism, person dependency are challenging for any organization. To remedy these issues, Xinthe introduced Dell Boomi AtomSphere - a multi-tenant cloud integration platform that bridges cloud and on-premises applications and data. This solution replaces the legacy processes with cloud-based integration processes, aptly named 'Atoms,' streamlining the data transfer among various applications.
<br /><br />
Xinthe re-engineered the entire project using Dell Boomi for the clients, integrating various tasks using workflows with a notable feature of in-built error handling, which automatically alerts end users via email about any failures at the source for EDI data. The processes developed within the Boomi integration to integrate EDI data, SFTP sites such as Haulers, Banks, and DTN Energy.

                    Customer has a retail pricing software available on premises. But when it comes to pricing of cigerettes, there are limitations to accommodate different factors. A customer specific solution, was specifically designed by Xinthe to automate and manage complex cigarette pricing scenarios, including parity, buydowns, and margin-based rules.
                    <br /><br />
					Cigarette pricing is intricate and requires detailed consideration of several factors like buydown periods, configure deals for two-pack items. To streamline this process, a user-friendly tool was built that allows customer to play and automate the calculation of cigarette prices in their stores. Tool provides playground for determining pricing with different factors and then applies the targeted margin to generate the new prices and are updated in the ERP for updated pricing in the stores. 'Red Flag Reporting' is also available for ensuring competitive pricing. Moreover, the tool can configure 'Price Down' discounts based on Parent-Child relationships among the products, adding another layer of versatility to pricing management.
                     <br /><br />
                     This solution is another testament to Xinthe's ability to understand complex client needs and deliver a tailored solution, offering significant efficiency and automation in the retail pricing process.
